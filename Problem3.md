# Problem 3

## C++
The *what* of C++ will be continuously covered during this 
course. Here, we get started with the *how*. A C++
program is written in a file with a `.cpp` extension. 
This file is said to contain the *source code* of the
C++ program. C++ is a *compiled language*, so a 
compiler compiles the source code into an object file
which usually has a `.o` extension.
